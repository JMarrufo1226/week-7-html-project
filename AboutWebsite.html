    <h1>About This Website</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This is the website I created entirely in HTML and is my submission for the week 7 assignment.
            It's a very simple website that includes the neccessary requirements, such as a list, images, links and a few other things. This is my first time attempting somethnig like this, so I hope it turns out well. 
        </p>
        <p>This website is based on a game I played as a kid and is my favorite in the series. Specifically, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. In the game there is a town that serves as the main hub, this website attempts to emulate said hub and its various services and locations.</p>
